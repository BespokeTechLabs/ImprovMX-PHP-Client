# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/bespoke/improvmx). Please review these guidelines before continuing.

## Guidelines

* Ensure that the current tests pass, and if you've added something new, add the tests where relevant.
* Send a coherent commit history, making sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.
* You may need to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.
* If you are changing or adding to the behaviour, please make sure the `CHANGELOG.md` and any other relevant documentation is kept up-to-date.
